Sorting Algorithm Visualization
Sorting Algorithm Visualization is a Python project designed to provide a visual demonstration of various sorting algorithms. The project utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interactively observe the sorting process.

Description
The project offers visual representations of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. Users can input parameters such as array size, minimum and maximum values for array elements, and select the sorting algorithm of their choice from a dropdown menu.

Once the parameters are set, users can generate a random array or input their own array data. They can then adjust the speed of the visualization using a slider control. Upon initiating the sorting process, the chosen algorithm will be applied to the array, and users can observe how the elements are rearranged step by step.

The visualization provides a clear and intuitive understanding of how each sorting algorithm operates, making it an educational tool for students and enthusiasts interested in learning about algorithms and data structures.

Key Features
Visual representation of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
Adjustable speed control for visualization.
User-friendly GUI for easy interaction and customization of parameters.
Display of time spent on sorting for performance evaluation.
Purpose
The Sorting Algorithm Visualization project serves as a valuable resource for individuals looking to comprehend sorting algorithms visually. By providing a hands-on learning experience, it helps users grasp the fundamental concepts of algorithmic sorting techniques and gain insights into their efficiency and performance characteristics.
